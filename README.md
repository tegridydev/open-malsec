# Dataset Card for Open-MalSec

## Dataset Description

**Open-MalSec** is an open-source dataset curated for cybersecurity research and applications. It encompasses labeled data from diverse cybersecurity domains, including:

- Phishing schematics  
- Malware analysis reports  
- Exploit documentation  
- Vulnerability disclosures  
- Scam methodologies and fraud intelligence  

This dataset integrates real-world samples with synthetic examples, offering broad coverage of threat vectors and attack strategies. Each data instance includes explicit annotations to facilitate machine learning applications such as classification, detection, and behavioral analysis. Open-MalSec is periodically updated to align with emerging threats and novel attack methodologies, ensuring ongoing relevance for both academic research and industry use.

### Dataset Sources

- **Repositories**: Combines public threat databases, cybersecurity whitepapers, real-world incident reports, and synthetic expansions.  
- **Future Updates**: Contributions from the open-source community, supplemented by curated threat intelligence feeds.

## Uses

Open-MalSec is designed to support a variety of cybersecurity-related tasks, including but not limited to:

### Direct Use

1. **Training and Fine-Tuning**: Model training for threat detection, phishing classification, malware behavior analysis, and vulnerability assessment.  
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Automated scrutiny of logs, suspicious artifacts, or compromised system footprints.  
3. **Research and Development**: Benchmarking novel AI methods for cyber threat intelligence, alert triaging, and risk analysis.

### Out-of-Scope Use

- **Unverified Production Deployments**: Deploying untested models based on this dataset for critical systems without rigorous validation or expert review.  
- **Malicious Exploitation**: Leveraging the dataset to facilitate or enhance illicit cybersecurity activities.

## Dataset Structure

Open-MalSec is organized into consistent data fields suitable for fine-tuning large language models and building specialized security tools.

### Data Fields

- **Instruction**: Task prompt or directive (e.g., “Analyze for phishing indicators”).  
- **Input**: Contextual information (e.g., suspicious URLs, malware snippets, vulnerability descriptions).  
- **Output**: Expected response (e.g., classification outcome, recommended actions).  
- **Sentiment**: Contextual sentiment label (e.g., *Negative*, *Neutral*, *Positive*).  
- **Score**: Numerical confidence value for the sentiment or classification.  
- **Metadata**: Supplemental annotations, such as threat category, date of incident, or unique identifiers.

### Data Instances

Open-MalSec is provided in JSON Lines (JSONL) format for straightforward integration with various machine learning frameworks. Below are representative examples:

```json
{
  "Instruction": "Analyze the following statement for signs of phishing and provide recommendations:",
  "Input": "Dear User, your account has been locked due to suspicious activity. Click here to reset your password: http://phishing-site.com",
  "Output": "This is a phishing attempt. Recommendations: Do not click on the link and report the email to IT.",
  "Sentiment": "Negative",
  "Score": 0.95,
  "Metadata": {"threat_type": "phishing", "source": "email"}
}
```

```json
{
  "Instruction": "Summarize the malware analysis report and highlight key indicators of compromise.",
  "Input": "The malware uses DLL sideloading techniques to evade detection...",
  "Output": "DLL sideloading is employed to bypass security. Indicators include modified DLL files in system directories.",
  "Sentiment": "Neutral",
  "Score": 0.88,
  "Metadata": {"threat_type": "malware", "platform": "Windows"}
}
```

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was developed to address the increasing need for high-quality labeled data in cybersecurity. By consolidating data from multiple, diverse sources—both real incidents and synthetic scenarios—Open-MalSec provides a robust foundation for training, evaluating, and benchmarking AI models focused on threat detection and mitigation.

### Source Data

- **Data Collection**: Curated from public repositories, security research articles, and incident summaries. Synthetic entries are programmatically generated to emulate real-world patterns while ensuring broad coverage of various threat types.  
- **Processing**: Data is standardized into the JSONL schema described above. Annotations are validated for consistency and quality through both automated checks and expert review.

### Annotations

- **Annotation Process**: Human annotators with cybersecurity expertise, assisted by automated detection tools, label and verify each example. Annotation guidelines include standardized threat classification taxonomies and sentiment scoring protocols.  
- **Annotators**: Security professionals, researchers, and vetted contributors from the open-source community.  
- **Personal & Sensitive Information**: Sensitive identifiers (e.g., emails, personal data) are anonymized or redacted where possible to maintain privacy and data protection standards.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

- **Technical Limitations**: Certain threat vectors or advanced exploits may be underrepresented.  
- **Data Bias**: Reliance on publicly reported incidents could introduce regional or industry biases. Synthetic examples aim to mitigate these imbalances but cannot guarantee full coverage.  
- **Risk of Misuse**: The dataset could potentially be used by malicious actors to refine or test illicit tools.  

### Recommendations

- **Validation**: Always validate model performance with up-to-date threats and conduct domain-specific testing before production deployments.  
- **Continuous Updates**: Contribute additional threat data and corrections to enhance dataset completeness and accuracy.  
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: Employ the dataset responsibly, adhering to relevant data protection regulations and ethical guidelines.
